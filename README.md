Initially the client expressed interest in beginning a kickstarter. They are interested in plays, specifically in Great Britian (GB).  The analysis began with an overview of each of the kickstarter campaigns in our dataset.

**GB - Launch date vs Success**

Looking further at the data, we decied to dive into how the outcomes played out based on their launch date, this was done in an effort to advise our client on when it was statistically the best time to create a succesful campaign.  

We recommended that our client begin their campaign in May or June; however, the window of success could be as large as April through July.

Our client was specifically looking to produce a musical, so we further looked at musical campaigns in GB.  From our data we created a box and whisker chart to analyze the requested goal vs the amount of money pledged.  We concluded that the average campaign goal was 2,800, while the median was 2,000, both of these fell within the range of the outliers for the amount pledged.  It was advised that our client should try to get their musical produced for less than 2,800 to have the greatest chance of success.
