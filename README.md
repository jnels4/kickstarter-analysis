Initially the client expressed interest in beginning a kickstarter. They are interested in plays, specifically in Great Britian (GB).  The analysis began with an overview of each of the kickstarter campaigns in our dataset.  


##Initial Analysis


Upon the initial analysis, it was concluded that theater was a viable category to begin a kickstarter campaign. Not only does theater have a large amount of campaigns, it can be conluded that most of the campaigns that were started were succesful. (see chart below)---
